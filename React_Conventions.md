# React Conventions

-    CamelCase component names
-    Functional components > Class components when there is no state to manage
-    Comments in the returned JSX space are left in `{/* syntax like this */}`
```JSX
return (
    {/*TODO: make a more interesting example*/}
    <div>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
	</div>
);
```

-    CSS class and id composite names using hyphens ' - '
-    Folder nesting probably should not exceed 3 or 4 levels
